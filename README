My attempt to learn haskell , has been greatly aided by the excersise problems in the book , Real World Haskell : http://www.realworldhaskell.org/blog/ and 99Haskell Problems : http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems

This repository has all my haskell programs for these problems.
